# Sanity LINQ
 **A strongly-typed .Net Client** for [Sanity CMS](https://sanity.io) with support for LINQ queries, mutations, transactions, joins, projections and more...


## Introduction
Sanity CMS is a headless CMS available at https://sanity.io with a powerful query API, file store and CDN.

Sanity LINQ was intially developed at [Oslofjord Convention Center](https://oslofjord.com) to facilitate development of .Net projects based on Sanity CMS.

Inspiration was drawn from the .Net client provided by [onyboy](https://github.com/onybo) at https://github.com/onybo/sanity-client.

The Sanity LINQ client goes beyond providing a simple HTTP client and introduces strongly typed queries, projections, mutations and joins - much in the same way as Entity Framework provides this for SQL.
